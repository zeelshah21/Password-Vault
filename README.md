# PasswordVault – Simple C Password Manager

PasswordVault is a lightweight command-line password manager built in C.  
It securely stores usernames and passwords using a custom hashing function and binary file storage.  
This project was created to practice file I/O, hashing, structs, and menu-driven application design.
